# Intro to usrbin.app

You either have built or are building a CLI that you want to have someone else install and use. The usrbin.app SDK is designed to solve some of the common problems and features that you'll run into when thinking about distributing your CLI.

We have other languages planned, but for now, we have a [Go SDK](https://github.com/usrbinapp/usrbin-go) that implements the current functionality. If you are excited to see a different language supported, please [open an issue](https://github.com/usrbinapp/usrbin) in our repo so we know!

To get started, you can [read about the concepts](./concepts/), or if you already understand them, head over to the [installation](./install/) page.
